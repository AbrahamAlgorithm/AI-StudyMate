## Project Overview
AI StudyMate aims to make learning more accessible by using AI and machine learning to analyze and solve academic problems from uploaded images. The application provides an interactive learning experience, offering detailed explanations to help students grasp complex concepts.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of questions or problems.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Extracts text and equations from images.
- **Subject-Specific Solutions:** Focuses on structural mechanics, strength of materials, physics, and mathematics.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations:** Detailed breakdowns of problem-solving steps.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Accessible on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask)
- **Frontend:** React.js or Angular
- **AI/ML Models:** Gemini pro vision
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Installation
To run AI StudyMate locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aistudymate.git
    cd aistudymate
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys).

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

2. Upload an image containing a question or problem.

3. Wait for the AI to process the image and display the solution.

4. Review the step-by-step explanation provided.

## Challenges
- **Image Recognition Accuracy:** Ensuring OCR and AI models accurately interpret questions.
- **Scalability:** Handling large volumes of image processing.
- **Subject-Specific Training:** Fine-tuning AI models for complex academic problems.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand subject coverage to include more disciplines.
- Add voice interaction for a more interactive experience.
- Implement user progress tracking and personalized feedback.
